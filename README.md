# Simpsons Fan Page

## Project Overview 
This project has been created for educational purposes. 

This blog is about all things Simpson's. You can read blog posts and comments, and interact once you're a user. 

## Version Control 

Github was used to track the progress of this project. Initial commits were lost as I restarted the project from VScode and then moved into GitPod. As I got more confident, I started checking in more regularly and multiple times a day.  You can see my evolution of more meaningful commit messages at: https://github.com/KateEllen/Simpsons-fan-page/commits/main

### Wire Frames 

The final result is slightly different as during the development stage the way things were displayed was not as user friendly as expected and I decided to go less minamilistic on the homepage.

## Styling

### Colours

The palette of colors for the site are primarily yesllow and black. They yellow is a classic reminder of the simpsons, and the black gave it a more defined look. 
I used the pink shade from the donut on top to make elements which you can hover over more noticible.
